            <h1>Pluto</h1>
            <p style="width: 50%;">Pluto, once considered the ninth planet of our solar system, resides in the distant Kuiper Belt, a region filled with icy bodies and remnants from the solar system's formation. Discovered in 1930 by Clyde Tombaugh, Pluto was reclassified as a "dwarf planet" in 2006 by the International Astronomical Union due to its size and the company it keeps in the Kuiper Belt. Despite its reclassification, Pluto remains a fascinating world with its own complex system of five moons, the largest of which is Charon. The New Horizons mission, which flew by Pluto in 2015, revealed a surprisingly dynamic surface featuring vast plains, towering ice mountains, and possible cryovolcanoes, suggesting that Pluto is far from a static, frozen world. This tiny, distant body continues to captivate scientists and the public alike, challenging our understanding of what it means to be a planet and offering a glimpse into the outer reaches of our solar system.</p>
