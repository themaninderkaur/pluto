            <h1>Pluto</h1>
            <p style="width: 50%;">Pluto, once considered the ninth planet of our solar system, resides in the distant Kuiper Belt, a region filled with icy bodies and remnants from the solar system's formation. Discovered in 1930 by Clyde Tombaugh, Pluto was reclassified as a "dwarf planet" in 2006 by the International Astronomical Union due to its size and the company it keeps in the Kuiper Belt. Despite its reclassification, Pluto remains a fascinating world with its own complex system of five moons, the largest of which is Charon. The New Horizons mission, which flew by Pluto in 2015, revealed a surprisingly dynamic surface featuring vast plains, towering ice mountains, and possible cryovolcanoes, suggesting that Pluto is far from a static, frozen world. This tiny, distant body continues to captivate scientists and the public alike, challenging our understanding of what it means to be a planet and offering a glimpse into the outer reaches of our solar system.</p>
                        <p style="width: 40%;">Pluto's unique characteristics extend beyond its physical attributes. Its orbit, for example, is highly eccentric and inclined, crossing the orbit of Neptune, which sets it apart from the more circular orbits of the planets in the solar system. This unusual path means that for 20 years of its 248-year orbit, Pluto is closer to the Sun than Neptune. Furthermore, Pluto's atmosphere, composed primarily of nitrogen with traces of methane and carbon monoxide, expands and contracts dramatically with its changing distance from the Sun, creating seasonal effects that are far more extreme than those on Earth. The presence of organic compounds on its surface, detected by the New Horizons mission, also hints at complex chemical processes that could be similar to those that eventually led to life on Earth. As we continue to study Pluto, both from afar and through future missions, it promises to deepen our understanding of planetary science and the history of our solar system.</p>
